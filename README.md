# Rubik's Cube
General Rubik's cube stuff
___
Usage:

Generating scrambles:

    ./scramble_generation/random_move.py
Create a 2D scramble visualisation:

    ./visualisation/ascii_template.py "SCRAMBLE HERE"
    (with inline scramble)
    
    ./visualisation/ascii_template.py
    (with scramble saved at ./visualisation/scramble.txt)
    
    ./visualisation/new_template.sh
    (generating a new scramble)
